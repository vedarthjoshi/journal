If I can read this I still exist. If I can hear this I still exist. for I can think of this I still exist.
the sole Existence the very own entity that I can call my own it exists with me because of me and dies with me. its my complex awareness wordified in somewhat readable and understandable form to some extent the authenticity of it purely depends on my ability to write, my vocabulary at given point of time when a word is written here or replaced here, that word, it could be word from English Gujarati Sanskrit Hindi Japanese Dictionary or created by me for that particular position of my writing  since if this is my try to express something this delicate I want it to be the prefect to each detail exactly the way I want , the structure of sentence, I write any language as I please in order to preserve its meaning its authenticity, I want every word I wrote here to emit the exact energy, meaning, tone shape, position, idea exactly the way it originally occurred to me or as much similar as it can be to that state when I wrote it. everything I write here I can call it my own regardless of its first use since that word exists because I positioned it I choose it to be there so I call it my own, that word has meaning what I gave it in my writings weather it matches with its original meaning or not so I see myself as an Owner of that word since anything I wrote here has any meaning only because I as Vedarth took the instance of that word and its meaning game a place in my mind and made it way to express something that I own language is not generalized but and individual system that each language understanding being tries to make their own version of it and makes a set of words and its meaning the way they understand, that sat of meaning collides with another language understanding being on wish of the first being, the intersection of that vocabulary(here pair of word and its meaning combined) is the possible way for one to have any way to communicate to the other and unfortunately the second array "the meaning of word" also happens to be individual so it boils down to only words in a language could be in that intersection of two person's scope of communication. lastly the third one observing the two complete sets its intersections may still not get a whole view due to his own meaning of words so in conclusion NO BEING having language as a way to communicate would ever be able to understand another so it is 100% possible that if you are anyone else then the Vedarth who wrote this would never ever be able to understand any of it the way I THE VEDARTH was able to understand, feel, express and therefore this thing also dies with me.
