        <p>Its past 5 pm and a man enters the park walking to a bench mechanically as if that man was coming every day to that bench, he must have developed a sense of ownership of that wooden old bench with a partially rusted metal handle. He sits on one side taking only space he needed, he sat as if even anyone passing from that bench would feel invited yet puts his bag so carelessly a bit away from where it could possibly touch him, as if he knows that no one in eternity is ever coming on that bench to join him. he catches his breath without extra activities like losing his tie and pull his collar or any such activity that would express his tiresome job so extravagantly he just sits there normally and makes himself now more comfortable putting his hand on rusted handle and laying his head down on whatever space the width of bench&rsquo;s support provided. He looks at the fading sky without a blink for it had also become a habit for him to watch the sky irrespective of its state it mattered little to him whether the sky was fading or rising, and not a single thing he had done since he came in the park was out of his regular routine. definitely he never imagined himself making a routine of anything let alone something he would consciously do in order to gain some peace. he truly had nothing but a great imitation of energy you would get from a person who is robbed of everything. but no one, no one in world could know that just by looking at him, once acknowledging him as a person like normally people would do in park, for the very little presence he was holding among children playing in front of him and people walking and talking around all the places they found themselves comfortable in, for them this simple man was the same comfortable in his own place who mustn&rsquo;t be disturbed by getting involved with him in any way, he came here to sit for a while must&rsquo;ve been had a hard day at work let the man have some peace. well not that any of the parties present there the man or the people and children were complaining, it all felt so natural to everyone haha what do you even call natural, everyone shaped their minds that this park was indeed in its equilibrium state where whatever it presented must be considered all natural.<br>
 <br>
On other hand man also held no desire he expects nothing from the sky or the people or the park its like another part of his job or maybe another job itself. he does feel like he is moonlighting but then shuts himself up since going home and doing chores can be also called job, hah well existing&hellip; &ldquo;haha guess anything I can possibly think would lead me to that, its Thursday tomorrow isn&rsquo;t it yeah its empty, gotta get the fucking groceries right well never mind today gonna get some dinner from Kirbies they got that beautiful fountain there, feels lively while eating. what am I gonna get&hellip;&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
An hour passes by as man decides to leave whatever thing he wanted to think forever to make himself a man he was before he sat on that bench but alas that has never happened before and is never going to happen again. even though unconsciously he knows its been an hour he decides to check his wristwatch anyways. It was ticking quickly, rhythmically for a moment he thought it was more interesting than anything in his life. &ldquo;it’s summer anyways wouldn&rsquo;t hurt sticking here for a bit more&rdquo; as he comforts himself again to stay for a bit longer. The world around his bench now seems more inviting, interesting maybe these are the times when you try to resist the urge to get back into human you were, this excitement, this ability to observe and extract beauty dissolves in me, you desperately find reasons to stick convince yourself of reasons and excuses that stop you from change. “But I will turn back into man I was, weather I wish it or not even if I were to die I am sure the last reflection I will see of myself would be this same wasted soul, the same tired eyes that doesn’t understand hope, it knows too much for its own good, I don’t know what will happen after my death but I know for sure Nothing, Nothing will be as colourless as that moment before it, It will my final revolutionary realization and acceptance that a beautiful blooming life can go away, for all I am now is as good as the ashes after my death that will fly away in the air of time”<br>
 <br>
“No, no maybe I will also catch the glimpse of my younger self maybe all this was for that smile I adored so much on my face before I close my eyes”<br>
 <br>
“Haha when was the last time closing my eyes widened a smile on my face?”<br>
 <br>
This was man’s cue to get up he knew that his timer to find interest again had ran out, he was standing on the end of the loop just a step short of turning back into the man he was before he came to the bench. the man this time without any resistance ah maybe with a determination tries to get up. And out of nowhere a red rubber ball flaps on his dark blue pants, the impact of ball due to its velocity pierces the space and hits his leg gently continuing its trajectory. a little girl appears before he lifts his eyes completely.<br>
 <br>
A young little girl about age of 7 rushing towards him but slowing as her eyes meet, the ball slips under the bench now unreachable from the girl hides behind man’s legs, the girl observes for a bit from the distance and her never faded smile shrinks a bit as she speaks “can you get the ball for me uncle? please!”<br>
 <br>
The man anticipates his movements as he realises it was first time someone had said something to him in this park, in his mind this little girls stuttering words kept echoing until man grasped control over his mind again and leaned down to get the ball, as he hands it over to the little girl with a smile girl smiles back and says “Thank you!”<br>
 <br>
The man tries to speak so many sentences “oh what a nice girl you are” “my pleasure young lady” “welcome, what is your name?” but the swiftness of the girl turning around and going back to his friends leaves man in state momentary regret and momentary acceptance, as he tries to lift his head again which he lowered to talk to girl, he couldn’t lift it the weight of his thoughts, so he tries to lift his eyes so he can watch the kids play his they fill with the liquid understanding what he will see lifting his eyes would be so beautiful that he won’t be able to accept it he wouldn’t want to see it as hollow as he was, his eyes start watering as he covers his face trying to suppress it the amalgamation of his sorrow and the beauty of world he envisioned disrupted him so much that man starts crying, he starts weeping as if he had lost someone close to him. Of course outside world finds a bit odd seeing a man cover his face but the man manages to fool the world after all if he can fool himself, world was still secondary to him, the man now desperately wants to stop the crying but he feels that only after a threshold he can stop.<br>
 <br>
Moments pass as park gets less crowdy the man stops hearing the sound of kids and people, the squeaking sound of swings and slides suddenly stops and the bird chirping now becomes noticeable the man uncovers his face, as he puts his hands on the rusty handle for a moment looks at the sky and then he gets up takes his bag and leaves as a bit of metal rust gets on the sleeve of his shirt and some dust drifts down the rusted handle shining the reflection of setting sun.</p>
