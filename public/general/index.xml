      <description>&lt;p&gt;its past 5 pm and a man enters the park walking to a bench mechanically as if that man was coming everyday to that bench, he must have developed a sense of ownership of that wooden old bench with a partially rusted metal handle. he sits on one side taking only space he needed, he sat as if even anyone passing from that bench would feel invited yet puts his bag so carelessly a bit away from where it could possibly touch him, as if he knows that no one in eternity is ever coming on that bench to join him. he catches his breath without extra activities like loosing his tie and pull his collar or any such activity that would express his tiresome job so extravagantly he just sits there normally and makes himself now more comfortable putting his hand on rusted handle and laying his head down on whatever space the width of bench&amp;rsquo;s support provided. he looks at the fading sky without a blink for it had also became a habit for him to watch the sky irrespective of its state it mattered little to him whether the sky was fading or rising, and not a single thing he had done since he came in the park was out of his regular routine. definitely he never imagined himself making a routine of anything let alone something he would consciously do in order to gain some peace. he truly had nothing but a great imitation of energy you would get from a person who is robbed of everything. but no one, no one in world could know that just by looking at him once acknowledging him as a person like normally people would do in park, for the very little presence he was holding among children playing in front of him and people walking and talking around all the places they found themselves comfortable in, for them this simple man was the same comfortable in his own place who mustn&amp;rsquo;t be disturbed by getting involved with him in any way, he came here to sit for a while must&amp;rsquo;ve been had a hard day at work let the man have some peace. well not that any of the parties present there the man or the people and children were complaining, it all felt so natural to everyone haha what do you even call natural, everyone shaped their minds that this park was indeed in its equilibrium state where whatever it presented must be considered all natural.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
