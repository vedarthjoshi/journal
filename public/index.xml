      <description>&lt;p&gt;If I can read this I still exist. If I can hear this I still exist. for I can think of this I still exist.&#xA;the sole Existence the very own entity that I can call my own it exists with me because of me and dies with me. its my complex awareness wordified in somewhat readable and understandable form to some extent the authenticity of it purely depends on my ability to write, my vocabulary at given point of time when a word is written here or replaced here, that word, it could be word from English Gujarati Sanskrit Hindi Japanese Dictionary or created by me for that particular position of my writing  since if this is my try to express something this delicate I want it to be the prefect to each detail exactly the way I want , the structure of sentence, I write any language as I please in order to preserve its meaning its authenticity, I want every word I wrote here to emit the exact energy, meaning, tone shape, position, idea exactly the way it originally occurred to me or as much similar as it can be to that state when I wrote it. everything I write here I can call it my own regardless of its first use since that word exists because I positioned it I choose it to be there so I call it my own, that word has meaning what I gave it in my writings weather it matches with its original meaning or not so I see myself as an Owner of that word since anything I wrote here has any meaning only because I as Vedarth took the instance of that word and its meaning game a place in my mind and made it way to express something that I own language is not generalized but and individual system that each language understanding being tries to make their own version of it and makes a set of words and its meaning the way they understand, that sat of meaning collides with another language understanding being on wish of the first being, the intersection of that vocabulary(here pair of word and its meaning combined) is the possible way for one to have any way to communicate to the other and unfortunately the second array &amp;ldquo;the meaning of word&amp;rdquo; also happens to be individual so it boils down to only words in a language could be in that intersection of two person&amp;rsquo;s scope of communication. lastly the third one observing the two complete sets its intersections may still not get a whole view due to his own meaning of words so in conclusion NO BEING having language as a way to communicate would ever be able to understand another so it is 100% possible that if you are anyone else then the Vedarth who wrote this would never ever be able to understand any of it the way I THE VEDARTH was able to understand, feel, express and therefore this thing also dies with me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was wondering what should I put in devlogs since I have already coded most of the core mechenics, and well forcing myself to write isn&amp;rsquo;t how I wanna do this, so I put hold to this whole website making phase and continued my devlopment.&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;I was to design and work on implementing Journal in a room and also a letterbox outside what I call Crimson Mansion and there I created these walls for room and trees so the letter box doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel so lonely.&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Bench With Rusted Handle</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Its&lt;/strong&gt; past 5 pm, and a man enters the park, walking mechanically to a bench with tiny attention as if the path he was walking on was predefined for him. the man was coming every day to that bench, he must have developed a sense of ownership of that wooden old bench with a partially rusted metal handle.&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;He sits on one side taking only the space he needed, he sat as if even anyone passing from that bench would feel invited yet he put his bag so carelessly, a bit away from him where it couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly touch him, he knew that no one in eternity is ever coming on that bench to join him.&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;he catches his breath without extra activities like loosing his tie and pulling his collar or any such activity that would express his tiresome job so extravagantly. he just sits there normally and makes himself now more comfortable putting his hand on the rusted handle, he lays down his head on whatever space the width of bench support provided. He stares at the fading sky without a blink for it had also become a habit for him to watch the sky irrespective of its state, it mattered little to him whether the sky was fading or rising, and not a single thing he had done since he arrived to the park was out of his regular routine or out of his order. Definitely, he never imagined himself making a routine of anything let alone something he would consciously do in order to gain some peace. He had nothing but a great imitation of the energy you would get from a person who is robbed of everything. But no one, no one in the world could know that just by looking at him, once acknowledging him as a person like normally people would do in the park, for the very little presence he was holding among children playing in front of him and people walking and talking around all the places they found themselves comfortable in, for them this simple man was the same &amp;ldquo;comfortable in his own place who mustn&amp;rsquo;t be disturbed by getting involved with him in any way, he came here to sit for a while, a hard day at work perhaps? let the man have some peace.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;well not that any of the parties present there, the man or the people and their children were complaining, it all felt so natural to everyone. Haha what do you even call natural now, everyone shaped their minds that this park was indeed in its equilibrium state where whatever it presented must be considered all natural. &amp;ldquo;A park is supposed to be a place to hang out with others known to you or come alone to get some peace right? Well, who decides that anyway?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;On the other hand, man also held no desire he expects nothing from the sky or the people or the park it&amp;rsquo;s like another part of his job or maybe another job itself. For him, it&amp;rsquo;s like moonlighting but then he shuts himself down from his thoughts since if he continued he knows that going home and doing chores can also be considered a job he hates, hah existence&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;haha guess anything I can possibly think of would lead me to this, yeah its Thursday tomorrow, right? It&amp;rsquo;s empty, gotta head to fucking  groceries, I am tired I&amp;rsquo;ll get the dinner from Kirbies they got that beautiful fountain there too, feels lively while eating. yeah&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;An hour passes by as man decides to leave whatever thing he wants to think forever to make himself the man he was before he sat on that bench. But that has never happened before and is never going to happen this time either. Even though unconsciously he is aware of the time, he decides to check his wristwatch anyways. It was, in fact, ticking quickly, rhythmically, that for a moment he thought it was more interesting than anything in his life, &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s summer anyways wouldn&amp;rsquo;t hurt sticking here a little longer&amp;rdquo; as he comforted himself again. The world around his bench had never been more inviting to him, each moment was his escape from the man he had become, interesting maybe these are the times when you try to resist the urge to get back into the human you were, this excitement, this ability to observe and extract beauty dissolves in me, you desperately find reasons to stick, convince yourself of reasons and excuses that stop you from &lt;strong&gt;change&lt;/strong&gt;, you procrastinate &lt;strong&gt;the change&lt;/strong&gt; you find ways to delay the change because its too costly to leave this former self. “But I will turn back into the man I was, whether I wish it or not even if I were to die I am sure the last reflection I will see of myself would be this same wasted soul, the same tired eyes that don’t understand the term &lt;strong&gt;HOPE&lt;/strong&gt;, it knows too much for its own good, I don’t know what will happen after my death but I know for sure Nothing, Nothing will be as colourless as that moment before it, It will be my final revolutionary realization and acceptance that a beautiful blooming life can go away so tragically, for all I am now is as good as the ashes after my death that will scatter away in the air of time leaving a faint weak reminder of a wasted soul.”&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;“No, no maybe I will also catch a glimpse of my younger self maybe all this was for that smile I adored so much on my face before I close my eyes, I wish I could see that, I would want them to have comfort on face, yes if anyone comes looking for it”&lt;br&gt;&#xA;“Haha when was the last time closing my eyes felt this good? no ones left”&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;This was the man’s cue to get up he knew that his timer to find interest again had run out, he was standing at the end of the loop just a step short of turning back into the man he was before. The man this time without any resistance ah maybe with a little determination tries to get up. And out of nowhere a red rubber ball flaps on his dark gloomy pants, the impact of the ball due to its velocity pierces the space and hits his leg gently continuing its trajectory. A little girl appears before his static state as he lifts his eyes.&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;A young little girl about the age of 7 rushes towards him but slowing down as her eyes meet, the ball slips under the bench now at unreachable distance from the girl without noticing the man, it hides behind the man’s legs, the girl observes for a bit from the distance and her never faded smile shrinks a bit as she speaks “can you get the ball for me uncl erm.. sir? please!”&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;The man anticipates his movements as he realises it was the first time someone had said something to him in this park, in his mind this little girls stuttering words kept echoing until man grasped control over his mind again and leaned down to get the ball admiring his decision, as he hands it over to the little girl with a smile girl smiles back and says “Thank you!”&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;The man tries to speak so many sentences&lt;br&gt;&#xA;“Oh what a nice girl you are”&lt;br&gt;&#xA;“My pleasure young lady”&lt;br&gt;&#xA;“Welcome, what is your name?”&lt;br&gt;&#xA;“And you are? cute missy!”&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;but the swiftness of the girl turning around and going back to his friends leaves the man in state of momentary regret and momentary acceptance, as he tries to lift his head again which he lowered to talk to girl, he couldn’t lift it the weight of his thoughts, so he tries to lift his eyes so he can watch the kids play. The eyes fill with the liquid understanding that whatever he will see is going to be so beautiful that he won’t be able to accept it he wouldn’t want to see it as hollow as he was, his eyes start startling as he covers his face trying to suppress it, the amalgamation of his sorrow and the beauty of world he envisioned, it disrupted him so much that man starts weeping as if he had lost someone close to him the momentary encounter of that girl echoed how his life worked, every bond he had, everyone that hold on to him, whenever he tried to reach them it was always too late. Of course, the outside world finds it a bit odd seeing a grown man cover his face suddenly but the man manages to fool the world after all, if he can fool himself, the world was still secondary to him. The man now desperately wants to stop the tears but he fails.. again.&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;well, he knows only after a certain threshold he can gather himself. &amp;ldquo;let it go&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;Moments pass as the park gets less crowdy The man stops hearing the sound of kids and people, the squeaking sound of swings and slides suddenly stops and the bird chirping now becomes noticeable the man uncovers his face, as he puts his hands on the rusty handle. For a moment looks at the sky and, he gets up takes his bag and leaves. The thin surface of the rusted handle is a little clear now the dust is gone too, and the handle now shines brighter in the reflection of the setting sun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A quentized figment of human consiousness randered into a game&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;now as I am writing it here this tagline feels so flashy lol&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;after banging my head to pc for 3 years to learn basic Game Devlopment I remembered why was I learing it in the first place.&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;Games are after all final form of &lt;strong&gt;art&lt;/strong&gt; they combine &lt;strong&gt;Art, Writing, Music&lt;/strong&gt; All sorts of practices that fall under &lt;strong&gt;art&lt;/strong&gt; you can put that into a game.&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;well around same time I stumbled upon a game I used to play Knytt Stories its a free game created by Swidish Game Devloper&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nifflas&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Nicklas Nygren (Nicklas)&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://egomassive.com/ks/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;you can get/see it here&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nifflas.fandom.com/wiki/Knytt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Knytt wiki&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/sept07/knytt2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;lol&#34;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;and man its a beautiful game with VAAAAAAAST world as its name suggests&#xA;Knytt (which roughly translates as &amp;ldquo;tiny creature&amp;rdquo; in Swedish) the world feels so huge and explorable in this game that I spent hours, I can go in any direction and most fascinating part was world was alive without me as a player, the in game creatures lived there and that felt quite amusing to watch creatures looking like humans live underground catching fishes in lava and 2 brothers fighting somewhere on shores of some river created from a waterfall thats located under the ocean man as vauge as this sounds I found it really cool it had a unique level design and artstyle to it that I haven&amp;rsquo;t played something like that in all these years playing countless games.&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;I wanted to create something like that, I wanted to tell something &lt;strong&gt;Knytt way&lt;/strong&gt; but well ofcourse being new to game devlopment reproducing that level of quality and polishing was wayy ahead of me. and thus born something broken and Originally named Bobba Square lol but renamed to &lt;strong&gt;Crimson Square&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;../../blogImages/CrimsonSquare/CrimsonSquarebig.png&#34; alt=&#34;Crimson Square&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Start by installing HUGO (ofc)&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;https://gohugo.io/&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/installation/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;https://gohugo.io/installation/&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;After installation you can verify if its working by typing&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cmd&#34; data-lang=&#34;cmd&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;hugo version&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope that shows something like this instead of error&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cmd&#34; data-lang=&#34;cmd&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;hugo v0.143.1-0270364a347b2ece97e0321782b21904db515ecc+extendedwindows/amd64 BuildDate=2025-02-04T08:57:38Z VendorInfo=gohugoio  &#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;and I presume you have a git installed already just like a normal insane person who doesn&amp;rsquo;t wanna use blogger or medium but just in case&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://git-scm.com/downloads&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;https://git-scm.com/downloads&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;so after that&#xA;go to the directory where you wish to create the website this command will make a root folder for itself so you just have to go somewhere like documents and create a template by writing&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why I Built This</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/journal/devlog/whyibuiltthis/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am Working on a Game called &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crimson Square&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and for a long time I wanted to make a structured wall of how the game was coming up and what progress I was making for my own refrence.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I would normally use &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; or Word for something like this(ofc) but then I thought what point would it serve if not published? I could go with &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; or google&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blogger.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; which would let me write and publish blogs for free but (heh) none of them provide complete customization of the way I wanted to render my blogs/devlogs, so I searched for something which does exactly what I want&lt;/p&gt;</description>
